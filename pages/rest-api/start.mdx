## API Versioning

<Callout type="error" emoji="❌">
  Some API and Gateway versions are now non-functioning, and are labeled as discontinued in the table below for posterity. 
  Trying to use these versions will fail and return 400 Bad Request.
</Callout>

Waifu.it exposes different versions of our API. You should specify which version to use by including it in the request path 
like `https://waifu.it/api/v{version_number}`. Omitting the version number from the route will route requests to the current 
default version (marked below). You can find the change log for the newest API version [here](https://github.com/WaifuAPI/api/releases).

**API Versions**

| Version | Status       | Default |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| 4       | Available    | ✓       |
| 3       | Deprecated   |         |
| 2       | Discontinued |         |
| 1       | Discontinued |         |


## Authentication

Authenticating with the Waifu.it API can be done using a token found on the **Dashboard** page within your settings. 
If you don't have an API token, then just head over to https://docs.waifu.it/faq, then read and get one for free.

For all authentication types, authentication is performed with the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: TOKEN`.

**Example Token Authorization Header**

```
Authorization: MTk4NjIyNDgzNDcxOTI1MjQ4.Cl2FMQ.ZnCjm1XVW7vRze4b7Cq4se7kKWs
```
